# SBSPS-Challenge-2683-Optimized-Warehouse-Management-of-Goods
# Problem Statement:  
   A food delivery service has to deal with a lot of perishable raw materials which makes it all, the most important factor for such a company is to accurately forecast daily and weekly demand. Too much inventory in the warehouse means more risk of wastage, and not enough could lead to out-of-stocks - and push customers to seek solutions from your competitors. The replenishment of majority of raw materials is done on weekly basis and since the raw material is perishable, the procurement planning is of utmost importance.
  
# Proposed Solution:  
Our solution model will be able to predict the amount of goods required for the upcoming week, as the current warehouse systems are not capable to predict the goods this will be a huge advantage and uniqueness of our solution model which can predict with the help of our machine learning algorithms. We will also use the cloud technology to store the data of goods so that the count and accuracy is maintained in our solution and we have also produced a simple web application for the users to work with our model, so that they won't find any difficulties in getting the results and to access all the features available easily.
